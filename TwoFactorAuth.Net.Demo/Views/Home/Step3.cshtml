<h2>Step 3: Store secret with user and we're done!</h2>

<p>Ok, so now the code has been verified and found to be correct. Now we can store the <code>secret</code> with our user in our database (or elsewhere) and whenever the user begins a new session, after logging in, we ask for a code generated by the authentication app of their choice. All we need to do is call <code>VerifyCode()</code> again with the shared <code>secret</code> and the entered code and we know if the user is legit or not.</p>

<p>Simple as 1-2-3!</p>
